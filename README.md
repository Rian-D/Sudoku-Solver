AI Semester 1 Coursework - First class achieved based on code efficiency, quality and a report.
Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Backtracking Algorithm, Constraint Propagation

Key Contributions:
- Implemented a Sudoku solver that efficiently finds solutions to any valid puzzle using backtracking.
- Utilised NumPy to handle grid operations, speeding up computations and reducing memory overhead.
- Integrated heuristic techniques, such as the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic, to improve search efficiency.
- Designed a constraint propagation mechanism to prune the search space by enforcing Sudoku rules early in the solving process.
- Optimised the algorithm for performance, achieving near-instantaneous solutions for most puzzles.

Skills Acquired:
- Strong understanding of recursion and backtracking search algorithms.
- Experience with heuristics for optimizing search-based problem solving.
- Proficiency in NumPy for numerical computations and efficient data handling.
- Knowledge of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
